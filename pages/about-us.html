    <h2>ABOUT US</h2><br>
    <p>Hi, everybody! We are Aníbal, Francis and Rafael, a group of friends from Uruguay, united by music.</p>
    <p>We were very fortunate to have met many years ago while the three of us were studying to become music teachers. Soon we realised that we had a common and vast musical taste that spans a lot of genres. Needless to say, we love to listen to records but also love reading books about music and sharing information. 
        For example, Aníbal has been a living musical encyclopaedia since times when WikiPedia wasn't even an idea and has a large collection of the most diverse vynil records we know; Francis is also an enthusiastic vynil collector and is always sharing happily his rare discoveries; and Rafael is a world music lover and computer nerd that loves to do a bit of musical research and archaeology when he likes something he has listened to.</p>
    <p>It's because we love to share our passion for these records that we created this page, in order to show the technical specifications of those recordings. 
        Even if some of them can be found on streaming platforms, we think that many times a lot of information gets lost in the way and not only it's very interesting but also very valuable. It is due to these specs that we know which musicians and technicians participated in the recordings, who were the producers and recording companies, in which studios they were made and so on. 
        Not less important is the beautiful artwork and designs that usually come along with these albums and embellish them even more. Therefore you will find here not only links to the music but also galleries of images of the vynils, cassettes and CDs editions that we are able to find.<br>
        We apologize if we give a little more attention to the music of our beloved Uruguay - it's just we're a little country with a lot of great artists!</p>
    <p>At last but not least, we would like to thank <a href="https://www.instagram.com/albumcoversuy/" alt="albumcoversuy">albumcoversuy</a> for letting us use some of the albums' restored covers. It's worth remembering that we don't own any rights of the music, images or videos that we publish here. We pursue no monetary profit at all, for our humble and only desire is to share all this magic that complements the wonderful musical richness of the world.</p>
    <p>We'd like to thank you for stopping by and invite you to leave any feedbacks, comments or suggestions which will be happily received.</p>
    <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
